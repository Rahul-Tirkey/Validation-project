# Validation-project
This is a project in which I have created a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website will validate your credentials according to the coded rules when you enter your credentials using the Get Started button on the webpage.
First of all download the zip file of the validation folder.
Extract it and place it in your storage.
Then open the folder using Visual Studio Code App.
Download the extension of 'Live Server' from the VS Code extensions.
After installing the extension a 'Go Live' button will appear at the bottom.
Click on it and it will take you to the webpage using your chosen browser.
Then click on Get Started and validate your credentials!
